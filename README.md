# Mini Project 9: Cloud Housted Notebook Skeleton

### Data Used

The data used for this notebook is a comprehensive list of NBA player regular season data from the 2021-2022 NBA season. It holds each players name, team, age, position, and a variety of season averages. The goal was to perform EDA and determine if there was a relationship between Field Goals made and Field Goals attempted. We are also curious in who was the most efficient player from within the arc.

### Ingest

We load in the data, and immediatly get rid of the "Rank" column, as it is just used for listing the players in alphabetical order, and has no use in this analysis.

### EDA

First, we decide to graph both Field Goal Attempted and Field Goals Made. We see an interesting graph, which demonstrates a strong positive correlation. But, we notice there are a few players that are slightly higher than the rest, more speicifcially more vertically higher than anticipated. So, we analyze them a little more.

We saw that there are 4 players who exhibited high scoring output, on good efficiency, as seen below.

### Conclusion

We can conclude that LeBron James was the most efficient high attempt scorer in the NBA during the 2021-2022 NBA Regular Season
